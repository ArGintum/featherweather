by Tulchinskiy Eduard, PhD-1 student


## Data source
[Data used in the project
](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d566eJK2pmq3oCyuI7IlVBg7ZxIpDwC-/view?usp=sharing)
See `datasets' subfolder for more information
we consider uploading data into this repository if it will be really needed (they are quite large).


### Instruction: 

1) clone this repository via
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ArGintum/featherweather.git
```

2) Upload data into ```datasets''' subfolder
3) Use IPython notebook ```Baselines.ipynd''' to get accustomed with quality metrics of baselines
4) Unzip baselines predictions if needed
5) Use IPython notebook ```Mainmodels.ipynd''' to get accustomed with our model and its training and evaluating
6) File ```models.py''' contains source code of different setups of our model, some baselines and custom loss functions
7) File ```model_eval.py''' containts source code for scoring procedures of our models
8) File ```utils.py''' contains source code of auxillary functions.
